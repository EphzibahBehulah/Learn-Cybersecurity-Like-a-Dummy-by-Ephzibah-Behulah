# Chapter 2: Protecting Your Passwords

## Why Passwords Matter
Your password is the key to your online accounts. A weak password is like leaving your front door unlocked. Hackers can guess or steal weak passwords easily.

## How to Create a Strong Password
- **Make it long**: At least 12 characters.
- **Mix it up**: Use letters (upper and lower case), numbers, and symbols (like ! or #).
- **Avoid personal info**: Don’t use your name, birthday, or pet’s name.
- **Example**: Instead of “Fluffy123”, try “Fluffy$unshine2023!”.

## Password Tips
- **Use a unique password for every account**: If one gets hacked, others stay safe.
- **Try a password manager**: Apps like LastPass or Bitwarden store passwords securely.
- **Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)**: This adds an extra step, like a code sent to your phone, to log in.

## What NOT to Do
- Don’t reuse passwords across sites.
- Don’t write passwords on sticky notes.
- Don’t share passwords with anyone, even friends.

**Quick Tip**: Think of a passphrase, like “I love to eat pizza on Fridays!” and tweak it for each site (e.g., “ILovePizza4Gmail!”).
