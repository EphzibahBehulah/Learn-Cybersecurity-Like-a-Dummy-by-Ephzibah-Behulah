# Chapter 3: Staying Safe Online

## The Internet Can Be Tricky
The web is awesome, but it’s also full of traps. Scammers and hackers use sneaky tricks to steal your info. Let’s learn how to stay safe.

## Watch Out for Phishing
Phishing is when someone pretends to be a trusted company (like your bank) to trick you into giving them your password or credit card info.
- **Signs of phishing**:
  - Emails or texts with bad spelling.
  - Urgent messages like “Your account is locked! Click here!”
  - Links that look weird (hover over them to check).
- **What to do**: Don’t click links in suspicious emails. Go directly to the company’s website.

## Safe Browsing Habits
- **Use trusted websites**: Stick to sites with “https://” in the URL.
- **Avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive stuff**: Like banking or shopping.
- **Clear your cookies**: These track your activity—delete them regularly.

## Spotting Scams
- **Too good to be true?** It probably is (e.g., “Win a free iPhone!”).
- **Double-check emails**: If “Amazon” emails you, check the sender’s address.
- **Trust your gut**: If something feels off, close the page.

**Quick Tip**: Install an ad-blocker like uBlock Origin to reduce pop-up scams.
