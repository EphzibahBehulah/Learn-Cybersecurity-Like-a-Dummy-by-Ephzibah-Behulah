# Chapter 4: Securing Your Devices

## Your Devices Need Protection
Your phone, laptop, and tablet are gateways to your personal info. Let’s lock them down!

## Keep Software Updated
- **Why?** Updates fix security holes that hackers can use.
- **How?** Turn on automatic updates for your operating system (Windows, iOS, etc.) and apps.
- **Don’t ignore updates**: That “Update Later” button is tempting, but don’t skip it.

## Use Antivirus Software
- **What is it?** A program that catches viruses and other bad stuff.
- **Free options**: Windows Defender (built into Windows), Avast, or Malwarebytes.
- **What to do**: Run scans regularly and keep it updated.

## Back Up Your Data
- **Why?** If your device gets hacked or breaks, you won’t lose everything.
- **How?** Use an external hard drive or cloud storage like Google Drive.
- **Tip**: Back up weekly or after big changes (like new photos).

## Lock Your Devices
- Use a PIN, password, or fingerprint to lock your phone and computer.
- Don’t use easy PINs like “1234” or “0000”.

**Quick Tip**: Set your phone to auto-lock after 1 minute of inactivity.
